Process:-
It should be an automation process in Selenium. It should involve Signup through Email for all different email servers and also for manually entering the Name, E-Mail ID & Password.

Introduction
that it is a Selenium automation project written in Java to perform web testing.

Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using Eclipse IDEA Community, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium 4, and Page Object Model (POM).

Test Subject
I've picked [https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login] as a test subject for no particular reason. It's is a large site and does have variety of features that we can play around with.

Libraries and Frameworks
Selenium - Web automation
Maven - Build and package management
TestNG - Test execution and Reporting

Tools
Using [Eclipse IDEA Community] [https://eclipseide.org/ version.] I've previously used Eclipse and found it to be a little bit slower and not as intuitive, you're free to try both and decide for yourself. Also there are a lot of comparison articles out there already.

Programming Language
I'm using Java SE version jdk1.8.0_111 and it works very well. There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:

It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
Because of the above two points it's possible to automate (testing) checking for iOS (Web and Native), Android (Web and Native) and Web platforms.
Prerequisites
Eclipse installed Browser (e.g., Chrome, firefox, Edge) for the browser you intend to Run.

Copy the repository's Git clone URL from GitHub. [ https://github.com/rahulvthorat/Omnify.git]
Paste the URL into the "URI" field in the Import wizard.
Click "Next" and Eclipse will automatically fill in the remaining fields based on the URL.
Select the branches you want to import and click "Next".
Choose the directory where you want to store the repository on your local machine.
Select a project wizard to use for importing the project. For example, if it's a Java project, choose "Maven Project". Click "Next".
Customize the project settings if necessary and click "Finish". Eclipse will clone the repository and import it as a project.
Once the import process is complete, the project should appear in the Package Explorer or Project Explorer view in Eclipse.
Note
Update project and Make sure you have the required plugins or dependencies installed in Eclipse to work with the specific project type. For example, if you're importing a Maven project, ensure you have the Maven plugin installed in Eclipse.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully import a GitHub project into Eclipse.
